# Data Analysis Project Using Python

This project focuses on analyzing the **Zomato dataset** to extract valuable insights about customer behavior, restaurant performance, and ordering trends. The dataset used in this project is **Zomato data.csv**, and we employ Python libraries such as `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn` for the analysis.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to answer several key business questions for Zomato. By analyzing the data, we aim to provide actionable insights that can help Zomato enhance customer satisfaction, improve restaurant offerings, and boost business operations.

### Key Questions Addressed:
1. **What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?**
   - Analysis to identify the most preferred restaurant types based on customer orders.

2. **How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?**
   - Evaluating the number of votes received by different restaurant types to understand customer engagement.

3. **What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?**
   - Investigating the distribution of restaurant ratings to determine the overall customer satisfaction.

4. **Zomato has observed that most couples order most of their food online. What is their average spending on each order?**
   - Analyzing online spending patterns of couples to help Zomato optimize marketing and offers for this group.

5. **Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?**
   - Identifying the customer preference between online and offline modes based on ratings.

6. **Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Zomato can provide those customers with some good offers?**
   - Finding restaurant types that receive more offline orders to help Zomato create targeted offers for offline customers.

## Dataset

The dataset `Zomato data.csv` contains the following key columns:
- **Restaurant Name**: Name of the restaurant.
- **Restaurant Type**: Type of restaurant (e.g., Cafe, Casual Dining, etc.).
- **Votes**: Number of votes each restaurant has received.
- **Rating**: Customer ratings of restaurants.
- **Order Mode**: Whether the customer ordered online or offline.
- **Cost for Two**: Average cost for a couple at the restaurant.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place the `Zomato data.csv` dataset in the root directory.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to start the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Analysis and Insights

### 1. Majority Restaurant Type:
- Using Python, we perform data analysis to determine which type of restaurant (e.g., Casual Dining, Cafe, etc.) has the highest customer orders.

### 2. Votes Per Restaurant Type:
- By aggregating votes for each restaurant type, we provide insights on which restaurants have the highest customer engagement in terms of votes.

### 3. Ratings Distribution:
- Analyzing the ratings given to restaurants to find the most common ratings received.

### 4. Couples' Average Online Spending:
- Zomato has observed that couples order more food online. We compute the average cost for two people for each order and analyze it.

### 5. Ratings by Order Mode (Online vs. Offline):
- A comparison of ratings between online and offline orders to see which mode has a higher satisfaction rate.

### 6. Restaurant Type with More Offline Orders:
- We identify which restaurant types receive more offline orders, helping Zomato plan marketing offers.

## Conclusion

The analysis from this project can help Zomato better understand customer preferences and restaurant performance. The insights derived from this data can be used to improve restaurant offerings, marketing strategies, and customer satisfaction.
